# Scott Hillman
I began my digital experience working in Sales Consulting & Analytics at Pandora Media. Before that I worked at a small digital advertising agency called Blacklight, focused on direct response media measurement. 

Currently, I'm learning front-end web development focused on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is to develop this skillset, along with more advanced programming languages, to become a product manager.
